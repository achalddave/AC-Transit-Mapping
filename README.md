# Bus Mapper

`Because buses look pretty on maps`

This was made duriing the Battle of the Bay Hackathon in October,
which is really just a blanket way of saying "sorry if there are
bugs." This should chart buses in realtime. 

If you want to run this, make a database called `gtfs` and load
`gtfs_table.sql` into it. Make sure you have node installed, and
run `node app.js`. Things should work.
